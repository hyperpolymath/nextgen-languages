# Me

> Visual, playful introduction to programming

**Status:** 📝 Placeholder - contributions welcome

## Overview

Me is the entry point to the my-lang family, designed for ages 6-8. It uses visual/block-based programming to introduce computational thinking without text-based syntax.

## Core Invariant

**Every action has a visible, immediate result.**

## Key Features

- Drag-and-drop blocks
- Immediate visual feedback
- Character-based narratives
- No syntax errors possible

## Concepts Introduced

| Concept | Representation |
|---------|----------------|
| Sequence | Stacked blocks |
| Repetition | Loop blocks with count |
| Conditionals | Fork-in-road blocks |
| Variables | Named containers |

## Example (Block Description)

```
[When green flag clicked]
  [Move forward 10 steps]
  [Turn right 90 degrees]
  [Repeat 4 times]
    [Move forward 10 steps]
    [Turn right 90 degrees]
  [End repeat]
```

## Getting Started

The Me environment runs in a web browser. Visit the playground:

https://github.com/hyperpolymath/language-playgrounds

## Progression

Me is the first step in the [[My-Language Family]] progression:

```
Me (ages 6-8) → Solo (ages 8-10) → Duet (ages 11-14) → Ensemble (ages 15-18)
```
