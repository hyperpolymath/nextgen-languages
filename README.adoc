*Parent repository for tracking and coordinating experimental language development*

**IMPORTANT:** This is a **PARENT REPOSITORY ONLY** - it contains documentation and tracking but NO implementation code.

== Overview

This repository serves as the central tracking hub for the Next-Gen Languages initiative—a coordinated effort to design and develop ten programming languages that collectively cover the full spectrum of modern software challenges, from AI-native development to formally verified real-time systems.

**All language implementations are in their respective canonical repositories.**

== Design Spectrum

The eight languages span a complete spectrum of concerns:

----
Abstraction Level:     Low ←————————————————→ High
                       Solo                   WokeLang

Verification Rigor:    Minimal ←——————————→ Maximal
                       WokeLang              Anvomidav

AI Integration:        None ←——————————————→ Native
                       Oblíbený              Ensemble

== Documentation

* `LANGUAGES.scm` — Detailed language specifications and comparison
* `META.scm` — Architecture decisions and development practices
* `STATE.scm` — Project checkpoint and session history
* `ECOSYSTEM.scm` — Project ecosystem relationships
* `PLAYBOOK.scm` — Operational playbook and workflows
* `AGENTIC.scm` — Agent-oriented language specifications

== Playgrounds

Interactive experimentation sandboxes are now integrated into each language's canonical repository under a `playground/` directory. This consolidation ensures all language-related code (implementation, examples, and experiments) lives in one place.

== Quick Start

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hyperpolymath/nextgen-languages.git
```

== Contributing

Each language welcomes contributions. See individual satellite repositories for language-specific contribution guidelines.
