= Next-Gen Languages

*A strategic ecosystem of experimental programming languages exploring emerging paradigms*

== Overview

This repository is the central hub for the **Next-Gen Languages** initiative within the link:https://gitlab.com/maa-framework[Mutually Assured Accountability Framework (MAAF)]. It coordinates the design and development of 10 programming languages organized into three families, collectively covering the full spectrum of modern software challenges.

== Language Families

=== My-Language Family (Progressive Complexity)

A unified language family with four dialects of increasing complexity, designed for progressive learning from ages 8-18.

[cols="1,1,2,2,1"]
|===
| Dialect | Age | Philosophy | Key Features | Status

| *Me*
| 8-12
| Educational, visual/Blockly-like
| Belief states, epistemic types
| 100%

| *Solo*
| 13-14
| Systems programming with affine types
| `effect`, `go`, `where { pre:, post: }`
| 40%

| *Duet*
| 15
| AI-assisted neuro-symbolic development
| `@synth`, `@verify`, `intent("...")`
| 30%

| *Ensemble*
| 16+
| Multi-agent orchestration
| `ai_model {}`, `prompt {}`, `AI<T>`, belief fusion
| 20%
